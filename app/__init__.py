              Harlingen. The valley is on the border between Tamaulipas, Mexico
              and the US. We are known for our amazing hispanic food culture and
              diabates which is not a good combo. We are also known for our
              amazing beach on South Padre Island and Boca Chica Beach which is
              divided by the Jetties. Boca Chica Beach has become more popular
              due to our new honary RGV resident Elon Musk that lives out
              somewhere on his launch pad near Boca Chica. We also hold the
              national title of poorest areas to live in the US and Texas, once
              again not the greatest thing to brag about.""",

              called Winter Texans or Snow Birds. They move down during winter
              time mainly because their states and or cities are frozen while we
              are warm and toasty during this time. You see many of them going
